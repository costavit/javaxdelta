Xdelta implemented in java

Sourceforge project link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta.

This library implements Josh MacDonalds xdelta binary diff algorithm in java.
More information on this algorithm can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta.

Included is some java code for finding primes copyrighted by Roedy Green.
See separate copyright note for that code in the file cmp/primes/Primes.use.

This implementation uses the GDIFF file format for storing binary deltas. 
There is also a patcher that takes a source file and a patch file in this
format and produces the original file.

TODO:
 - create unit test for delta generation and patching with random data
 - other output formats
