Xdelta implemented in java

Sourceforge project link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta.

This library implements Josh MacDonalds xdelta binary diff algorithm in java.
More information on this algorithm can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta.

Included is some java code for finding primes copyrighted by Roedy Green.
See separate copyright note for that code.

This implementation uses the GDIFF file format for storing binary deltas. 
There is also a patcher that takes a source file and a patch file in this
format and produces the original file.

Some links to other delta / diff implementations in java

    * jrcs, both an rcs implementation and difference engine in java.
    * GNU diff ported to java.
    * XML diff and merge tools, from IBM AlphaWorks
    * not a java tool, but the google directory's page on File Comparison.
